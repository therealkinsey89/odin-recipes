        This dish is a holiday favorite! All of the friends and family love to eat those soft Christmas cookies... I know my kids do. These cookies are perfect for anybody at Christmas time. However, as a secret between you and me, I make them year round.

    <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup margarine, softened</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together, set aside. In a large bowl, cream together the margarine and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Gradually blend in the sifted ingredients until fully absorbed. Cover dough, and chill for 2 hours.</p></li>
        <li><p>Oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. On a clean floured surface, roll out small portions of chilled dough to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut out shapes using cookie cutters.</p></li>
        <li><p>Bake 6 to 8 minutes in the preheated oven, or until edges are barely brown. Remove from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks.</p></li>
    </ol>
